## Practical Application III: Comparing Classifiers

Overview: In this practical application, the goal is to compare the performance of the following classifiers K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.


this implementation is based on the CRISP-DM methodology, Our dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository


# Business understanding 

The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. 

The business goal is to find a model that can explain if a client subscribes to a deposit. Such model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect success, helping to better manage the available resources (e.g. phone calls, time) and selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential buying customers.

# Data understanding 

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
